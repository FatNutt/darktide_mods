# Better Buff Management

## Todo
- apply_material_values ERROR IS NOT CODE RELATED? AT LEAST NOT DIRECTLY? CHECK DUMP FILES AND OTHER CACHE STUFF
    - Maybe go back to dynamic if can figure out?
- Hide buffs from bars
- Add setting to toggle default buff bar
- Add extension function UIManager for recreating hud
- Stack buff bars upwards incase user doesn't have custom_hud
- Create buff bar huds dynamically
- Sort options for buffs (Alphanumeric)
- Move grouping and buff_bar tracking to mod_data?
